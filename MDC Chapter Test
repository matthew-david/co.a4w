We live in an on-demand world the way we, especially as Americans, consume, travel and entertain depending upon services and organizations that can give us what we want, when we want it, and how we want it.  
Universally, statistics show that births outnumber deaths by more than 2 to 1 daily, and thus, yes, globally we continue the trend of overpopulating our planet.  The $3 Trillion-dollar global apparel industry is in great need of adopting the technological advancements in digitization and automation that other global industries have benefitted from for years in order to drive progress and new efficiencies in this industry.  At last check, most people on earth wear clothes and continue to increase the demand for fashion and apparel products.  Whether it be in work wear, haute couture, ready to wear, active wear, maternity, special occasion, children’s wear and the list of segments goes on; of course, some sectors continue to grow faster than others, however, the net/net is: more clothes will be made in the future especially in the this age of consumerism and personalization, but the pressing questions, how, who and what methods will change the luddite mindset that infects this industry and causes it to shy away from the adaptation to existing and new technologies in the market place?  What new methods, technologies and avenues can this industry take to increase productivity, while meeting the specific needs of the ‘new’ consumer as brands, retailers and designers bring and sell clothes in this global market?
 The biggest apparel brands in the world like Nike, H&M, Inditex, LVHM, Adidas, Uniqlo, Hermes, VF Corp. surely understand this and yet essentially all these brands, and virtually all other smaller and emerging brands operate from an inefficient concept to commercialization paradigm that was developed decades ago.
Think this isn’t true?  
Just research, or rather, ask an executive at one of these organizations, or similar, how long it takes to introduce a new product to a consumer.  Many companies we’re familiar with work off time horizons between 6-14 mos. and the industry leader in the global enterprise segment is Inditex, where it has been said to be able to get a new product to shelf in as little as 3-4 weeks, but this is certainly not their entire SKU count. Additionally, the caveat with this is the ‘newness’ of the style that is said to hit this time mark (i.e. carryover).  Related to this, sustainability, environmental awareness and living wage practices are not considered in this equation, and yes, overdevelop and the consequent mark downs at retail, still affect the most prominent of brands, retailers and designers.
(Address why this is?) 
There are several reasons why this design, production and go-to-market model is still in existence and we will take a tertiary look at some of the contributing factors, however, by no means will we fully peel back the onion, so to speak, as surely it will have most crying over the dysfunction that remains in the concept to commercialization chain.  The incumbent technologies that many in this industry employ, and the tragic lack of connectedness between seemingly complementary solutions is one of the driving reasons for this bootlessness.  Instead of driving ourselves into a state of utter melancholy and despair if we dove too far into this quagmire, we will explore a different approach to manufacturing (relying on digitization and automation), that of which has been proven quite successful in other industries and a paradigm that is incredibly popular and pervasive, not only in this country, but around the globe. This model is what is termed the on-demand, just in time, or quick response model (nothing entirely new). 
Related to that, it should know that much of the content in this book has been written by ‘2 boomers,’ gentlemen with no foundational apparel industry experience, and a flare for not caring about styles, what’s popular, what isn’t, etc. and perhaps most important, traditional production conventions and norms (especially the existing models that hamstring the industry). This proves to be a strength and on occasion, a weakness.  Both gentlemen evangelized and steered early adopters of the on-demand movement to create a whole new paradigm in the book printing/publishing industry. The on-demand model that they instituted drove a new market and increased profitability and efficiencies in what was once an extremely slow to move, unprofitable and waning industry.  One wrought with waste, lost profits and dead inventory. 
As someone with experience in both the retail and production aspects of the apparel and fashion industry, I can attest this is not a too far different state of wellbeing, or lack thereof, from the book printing industry before on demand turned it on its ear.  I hear the conversations that swirls around at industry mixers, global trade events, fashion consortiums/shows and the like.  I read agendas for group groveling sessions and seeing the plaguing questions constantly published related to how the industry gets better, faster, more profitable, able to meet the demands of the consumers and so on and so on and so on…  More so, there seems to be so much empty rhetoric on exactly how, who and what truly innovative and connected solutions, both technology and apparel companies, are implementing to bring their products to market in a more profitable and sustainable manner, breaking from this antiquated, cumbersome and destructive model.  Consequently, we all who keep a pulse on this industry, have witnessed the penalties and loss that has been suffered, and continues to paralyze many players in this industry, because they have chosen not to evolve their businesses, by refusing to seek out and embrace a more future proof, updated model (that being, producing a garment, once it is sold vs. producing a garment, based on arbitrary forecasts and predictions of some future state of consumer demand for a specified good which may or may not sell at its projected and profitable price point).
Einstein said, “Insanity Is Doing the Same Thing Over and Over Again and Expecting Different Results…” 
Is this damn industry ever going to change, or just keep up with the platitudes?  Is the technology and services that are ‘provided’ to and that the industry is predicated upon ever going to change, be truly innovative?  Will some white knight hackers ever understand the amount of money that could be made to drive disruptive opportunity, and consequently, create applications that will ‘connect’ the disparate tools that all major in emerging brands in this industry use to design, market, produce and sell their products?  Seriously, anyone, anything going to really change the way one day your flip phone was replaced by typing on a phone via a large piece of glass?  Now, that’s change, and who could argue, that wasn’t successful and perhaps influential???
We know and are familiar with the long forecasted, stale products, ‘broken design, produce and hope to sell at MSRP’ model in the fashion and apparel industry.  The brands and retailers that still prescribe to this archaic model benefit from pigeonholing themselves and their consumers into an outdated, and frankly, dead model, however, the upside for them they believe is in focusing on the cheaper aspects of this existing model (mention Supply Chain practices???), and yes, they usually do not pay attention to, or fully comprehend what unit cost is.  Furthermore, they are risk averse and don’t want to fully pursue the value and increased profits of offering something curated and chosen by the consumer, produced by them utilizing an on-demand methodology.
These are the laggards that are avoiding the subscription economy and the ones who’ll ultimately go the way of the dinosaur in this new age of retail in fashion and apparel.
Also keep in mind again this model of on-demand is nothing entirely new!  For years thought leaders have talked about driving this type of business model in the global fashion of and apparel industry.  Given this isn’t a completely new concept, it should not be that challenging to fast forward and push the on-demand revolution, as is simply makes some much financial sense in several regards.  Furthermore, it doesn't necessarily require massive venture capital or technology services or a viral marketing scheme, it simply requires identifying the barrier(s) and finding a way around it – we have done this with OPM and PAAT.  And, as the industry realizes that this on-demand model is gaining momentum, which is has in recent years, more lemmings will follow this more profitable and progressive model.  
Although who knows?  If we use history as our guide, something must give, and there will be more reticence in the near future than acceptance, so let’s see and cheer for the innovators who want to modernize and the forward thinkers who want to seize the opportunity and understand the myriad of benefits on-demand can most assured provide.
So, getting back to our main objective, what does on demand really mean and given the claim made above regarding its pervasiveness, where does it, or rather, doesn’t exist?
While they are not to confused, on-demand, from my/our perspective shares its existence thanks in part to both the subscription and sharing economy.  Maybe there will be more on this later, maybe not, either way, back to On-Demand.  Those two other concepts are something for you the reader to think about and consider… 
Have you ever heard of Spotify, Starbucks, Hulu, StitchFix, Grub Hub, Pandora, Lyft, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Netflix and the list goes on…???
Think about the world we live -- you need your dog walked and fed, you want your car washed, you want to listen to a song that was your favorite in high school, you want a custom made latte, someone to mount shelving in your garage, there is an app to enable all of these products and services to be brought to fruition, data stored somewhere to enable this; organizations, individuals and solutions at the ready, with inventories of product and/or data, services to meet your personalized and immediate requests, made and executed upon or delivered specifically for and to you-
BUT, do you really know what on demand means, and if this is so prevalent, then what is up with this industry??? (revisit w/opining later)
On demand means the consumer has the ability to choose a product or service (or create one themselves) from their favorite brand or organization, personalize their order and not be forced to settle for something that maybe isn't personally curated to their tastes or desires.  The concept of on-demand also assumes that the aforementioned consumer receives that good or service in a relatively small amount of time.
Think about it, on demand companies such as Spotify, Grub Hub, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu even your local cable company…what do you want to watch, hear, eat, and so forth?  Think is doesn’t exist, think again!
On demand is also going above and beyond normal customer expectations by making a service or product distinctive and offering new and existing partners and clientele not just what you think they'll want now, but things that you believe they could want available to them in the future – look at the Starbucks model, how many types of lattes, tea, blended drinks, smoothies, etc. can you on-demand order for yourself (86k+ combos)? This mind you started with basic coffee, or to some, brown caffeinated water.  In 1971 Starbucks was created, as a coffee bean roaster, named after a famous character in Moby Dick…they sold no coffee, coffee drinks and the like for the first several years of their existence.
However, about 10 years after their humble beginnings one of the founders of Starbucks hired a marketing guy named Howard Schultz, and shortly thereafter on a business trip to Milan, Schultz had his ‘ah-ha’ moment visiting and watching how cafés there operated.  Then in 1987 the owners of Starbucks decided to sell, Schultz wanted it to drive his vision, consequently raised money (buying SBUX for approx. $3M) on the promise of opening an additional 125 stores in the next 5 years, and well, you know where this goes from here…on-demand, personalized products, sold at a premium price, AND delivered quickly.  AND, if it’s not done right the first time, it will be done however many times till the customer is thrilled to pieces.  How’s that for a foundation to create a NPS?
On that note, on demand also has to do with immediacy -- meaning not in an hour or not in 3 weeks you really can't say a service, or a product offering is on demand if you cannot provide what is being demanded when it is being demanded, or can you, and what is a reasonable amount of time based on the good or service you are offering? (Opine answer, 5 business days in this industry)
Before we jump into the benefits this could offer the fashion and apparel industry, let’s go back for a moment and look at the hospitality sector and specifically the restaurant industry.  For the On-Demand provider there's also tremendous value in this because it does not leave enough space or time for a potential customer to look elsewhere for what he or she believes may be a better option than your service and/or product, this gives the on-demand provider a major competitive advantage.  Of course, this presents its own challenges for the vendor.  Think about maintaining inventories of scale, warehousing and the logistics of picking it up and shuffling supplies and inventories back and forth through third parties, the goods and or services which you offer that comprise your value-added offering of being an ‘On-Demand’ business.  Of course, this is considering an ODMing provider will be offering variations, different styles or, let’s say metaphorically, menu items, ordered on demand and in a quantity the end consumer wants.
(What is there was a connected community/ecosystem and/or network where all of these ‘ingredients, being thread, fabric or bread, salmon existed and where accessible)?  Develop this more?
Do you know who consistently lands at the top of the list yearly when America’s best restaurants are rated?
